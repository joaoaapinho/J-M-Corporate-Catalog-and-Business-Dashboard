<h3 align="center">J&M Corporate Catalog and Business Dashboard</h3>

<h2> Overview <h2>

<p> For many companies one of their main challenges passes through keeping their employees motivated and engaged while ensuring that they still make informed decisions to drive business success. To address this need, **J&M**, a renowned international clothing brand, has undertaken a project to develop an **exclusive employees' catalog** and an **interactive dashboard for top management teams**.

The employees' catalog is a web page that features all the upcoming items that are set to drop in the next weeks before customers are notified. This catalog is designed to motivate employees by giving them access to exclusive information and products before they are available to the general public.

The top management team, besides the access to the catalog, has also access to a fully interactive business dashboard that provides them with important KPIs and charts to empower their teams to make more informed and performance focused decisions. This dashboard was built using Streamlit and retrieves data from a Google Cloud MySQL database through several Flask RestX API endpoints.

To ensure that only authorized employees have access to the catalog and dashboard, the project incorporates two completely different authentication methods.

Overall, this project aims to improve employee motivation and the efficiency and efficacy of business decisions by providing employees with exclusive information and senior management with the tools they need to make informed decisions. The catalog is built using Flask and HTML templates, while the dashboard is developed using Streamlit, Flask RestX API endpoints, and Google Cloud MySQL.
